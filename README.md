## Mathematics Simple Library

A C++23 header-only mathematics library with focus on convention consistency, extensibility and readability while leaving micro-optimizations to the compiler.

It does what you'd expect from an average utility library, to get a feeling what it's like to use it, see [main.cpp](/main.cpp). For concrete examples of use within applications, see [samples](/samples).

## Note

This is a development branch and is a subject to breaking changes, see [v1](https://github.com/AnonN10/mathematics_simple_library/tree/v1) for LTS expression-templates based version, or [truly-simple](https://github.com/AnonN10/mathematics_simple_library/tree/truly-simple) for barebones naive implementation.
