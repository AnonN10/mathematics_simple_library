## Mathematics Simple Library

A header-only mathematics library with focus on convention consistency, extensibility and readability while leaving micro-optimizations to the compiler.

It does what you'd expect from an average utility library, to get a feeling what it's like to use it, see [main.cpp](/main.cpp). For concrete examples of use within applications, see [samples](/samples).
